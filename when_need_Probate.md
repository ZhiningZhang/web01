| Situation                                       | Why Probate Is Avoided                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assets held in a living trust**               | Trust owns the assets; avoids court involvement      |
| **Joint ownership with rights of survivorship** | Property automatically passes to the surviving owner |
| **Accounts with named beneficiaries**           | Like IRAs, 401(k)s, life insurance, POD/TOD accounts |
