## ðŸ“¦ Common Types of Trusts

### 1. **Revocable Trust (Living Trust)**

* Can be changed or canceled by the grantor at any time.
* Becomes **irrevocable** upon the grantorâ€™s death.
* Avoids probate (the court process of settling a will).
* Assets remain in your control while you're alive.

### 2. **Irrevocable Trust**

* **Cannot be changed or revoked** once created (with rare exceptions).
* Assets are removed from your estate (useful for **estate tax reduction**).
* Offers better **asset protection** from creditors or lawsuits.

### 3. **Testamentary Trust**

* Created **through a will** and takes effect only after the grantor's death.
* Goes through probate.
* Often used for minor children or special needs dependents.

### 4. **Special Needs Trust**

* Provides financial support for a disabled person without affecting government benefits (like Medicaid or SSI).

### 5. **Charitable Trust**

* Created to benefit a **charity or cause**.
* May offer **tax benefits** to the grantor.

### 6. **Spendthrift Trust**

* Limits a beneficiaryâ€™s access to the trust funds.
* Helps protect assets from poor spending habits or creditors.
