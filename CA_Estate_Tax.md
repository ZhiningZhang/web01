Great question! Here's a clear explanation of the **California estate tax**:

---

## 🟢 **Does California Have an Estate Tax?**

> **No — California does not currently have an estate tax or inheritance tax.**

So if someone dies while a California resident, **only federal estate tax** may apply — and **only if the estate is large enough** (over \~\$13.61 million in 2025).

## 📜 Historical Note

* California **used to have an estate tax** (called a **“pick-up tax”**), but it was repealed in 2005.
* It ended because the federal government eliminated the state estate tax credit that supported it.
* As of now, there is **no separate California estate tax law**.

## 💡 But Be Aware of These California Estate Issues:

Even without a state estate tax, you should still consider:

### 🧾 1. **Probate Costs**

If assets aren't properly titled (e.g., not in a trust or TOD), **California probate can be slow and expensive**.

| Estate Size | Approx. Probate Fees (statutory) |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| \$500,000   | \~\$13,000+                      |
| \$1 million | \~\$23,000+                      |

> ✅ Avoid probate by using a **revocable living trust**, **TOD deeds**, or **beneficiary designations**.

---

### 🏡 2. **Real Property Reassessment**

* Property inherited in CA may be **reassessed** for property tax purposes under **Prop 19 (2021)**.
* This can lead to a **big increase in annual property taxes** for inherited homes.

✅ Use estate planning to **preserve Prop 13 benefits** where possible.

---

### 🛡️ 3. **Planning Still Matters**

Even without a CA estate tax:

* You still need a **will, trust, and beneficiary designations**
* You still face **federal estate tax** if your estate is large
* Good planning can **save time, legal fees, and family conflict**
