**Probate** is the **legal process** through which a deceased person’s **will is validated**, and their **assets are distributed** under court supervision. If the person **didn’t leave a will**, probate still happens to determine **how their estate will be divided**, following state law.

## ⚖️ In Simple Terms:

Probate is the court's way of making sure:

1. **Debts and taxes are paid**
2. **Assets go to the correct heirs or beneficiaries**

| **With a Will**    | The court ensures the **will is valid**, and assets are distributed accordingly. |
| **Without a Will** | Called **intestate** — the court uses **state laws** to decide who gets what.    |
